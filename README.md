# Logic Quest Game

**Logic Quest** is a logic-based puzzle game written in JavaScript. It challenges players to navigate a path from the start to the goal using logical reasoning and grid-based clues.

## Motivation

This game was developed as a semester project to demonstrate JavaScript DOM manipulation, dynamic UI rendering, and logical game mechanics. The goal was to create an engaging logic game that works entirely in the browser without external dependencies.
