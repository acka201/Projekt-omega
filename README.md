# Logic Quest Game

## Description

Logic Quest is a bilingual (Hungarian and English) console adventure game developed in F#. In this game, players create a profile and then embark on an interactive journey filled with puzzles, combat encounters, and narrative choices.  
  
Gameplay elements include:  
- **Math Puzzles:** Solve quick arithmetic challenges to proceed.  
- **Combat Encounters:** Engage in battles with enemies using various attack and defense strategies.  
- **Story Narratives:** Choose your path during branching story events, with narratives loaded from external text files specific to each level.  
- **Level Progression:** Earn XP and level up (up to level 10) with each successful encounter. On leveling up, new quests and items are loaded from language-specific text files (e.g., `level3_hu.txt` or `level3_en.txt`).  
- **Profile Management:** Save and load your profile as a JSON file so you can continue your adventure later.

The game also features simple graphical enhancements for a better console experience‚Äîusing ASCII art, colored text output, and brief animation sequences.

## Motivation

The goal of Logic Quest is to offer an engaging and challenging interactive experience that not only entertains but also hones vocabulary, quick thinking, and problem-solving skills. Its bilingual nature and dynamic level system ensure that players of different backgrounds and skill levels can enjoy the game.

## Development Environment

- **Language:** F#
- **Target Framework:** .NET (6 or newer)
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `System.IO` for file handling
  - `System.Text.Json` for JSON serialization (saving/loading profiles)
  - `System.Threading` for implementing pause-based animations
- **IDE Options:** Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any F# compatible development environment

## Features

- **Bilingual Support:** Choose between Hungarian and English from the start; all game messages, quests, and UI elements adapt accordingly.
- **Dynamic Level System:** Leveling up is tied to experience (XP). Each new level (maximum of 10) loads external text files containing new quests and items.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players must solve math puzzles, engage in combat with diverse enemies (complete with ASCII art visuals and color-coded output), and make narrative choices during story events.
- **Profile Management:** Create a new game profile, save it as a JSON file, and reload it later so you can resume your adventure.
- **Enhanced Console Presentation:** The game uses simple ASCII graphics, colored text, and short animations (such as a trailing dot effect) to enrich the console experience.
